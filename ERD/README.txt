Notes,
	REGISTRATION_ACCOUNT, which included all the information needed by the APP. 
	EMPLOYEE_INFO, which included the employee's email address and employee's id
	OFFICE_ROOM assumes that many employees would work in the same room and that the office room may be empty with no employees.

To be specific,
	1. As the employees mandatorily need to sign up for an account, one and only one EMPLOYEE will register one and only one account. The primary key of the EMPLOYEE entity is the employee's id. And the REGISTRATION_ACCOUNT's primary key is also the employee's id.
	2. The email address is optional when the employee signs up for the APP. Accordingly, one or zero EMPLOYEE_INFO is provided to one and only one REGISTRATION_ACCOUNT entity.
	3. The company would randomly scan employees' temperatures. Therefore, one and only one REGISRTATION_ACCOUNT owner takes zero or more FEVER_TEST. Zero correspondings to the random nature of the scanning test. As the people will not be tested twice simultaneously, the fever test is specified by the test date with time and the id of that scanned employee.  
	4. Employees can also self-report if they develop covid-19 symptoms. The report is just committed by the man who submits it, not others. But one employee may report several times. Thus, one and only one REGISRTATION_ACCOUNT informs zero or many SELF_REPORT. Zero if the man is fortunate and never fell unwell. The many case is just the opposite. 
	5. Those who have a fever or display a high temperature have to take a lab test. And one lab test operation is for one request. Consequently, one and only one FEVER_TEST result would result in zero or one LAB_TEST. Zero lab test if the fever test's temperature is regular.  One if the unnormal temperature detected.
	6. Similarly, one and only one SELF_REPORT results in zero or one LAB_TEST.
	7. At random, an employee will also be selected for testing. The test just shows the lab results of that person. Hence, one and only one REGISRTATION_ACCOUNT owner is chosen to take zero or many LAB_TEST. That guy may not be singled even one time or can be picked several times. 
	8. As soon as the employee tests Positive, they need to self-quarantine for two weeks and report their health status. But the lab test could be Negative, so that would not lead to quarantine. Then, zero or one QUARANTINE is caused by one and only one LAB_TEST. 
	9. Quarantine is for a specific person. So, one or zero QUARANTINE restricts one and only one REGISRTATION_ACCOUNT owner. Zero is for not tested or tested negative.
	10. Close contact between employees that happens during meetings is always recorded. I am assuming that is implemented by storing the meeting schedule of employees. The MEETING entity stores the allocated meeting room number, date, time, and the meeting schedule ID as PK. The meeting at least needs one employee, and some employees may not need to participate in the conference even once. Hence, one or many REGISRTATION_ACCOUNT owners would attend zero or many MEETING. 
	11. The MEETING_ROOM entity contains the property of the meeting room using the meeting room id as PK. Clearly, a meeting only needs one room, and a room may have a lot of arrangements. So, one and only one MEETING_ROOM is used for one or many MEETING.
	12. As mentioned in the problem description, employees on the same floor as the sick employee would be notified. OFFICE_ROOM is used for storing information regarding the room, like the number, the floor, and so on. The office room may be empty with no employees. But one employee can only own one office room. Therefore,  one and only one OFFICE_ROOM has zero or many REGISTRATION_ACCOUNT owners.

Tracing realizationï¼Œ 
	1. As specified in the problem description, close contact is always recorded. And, it could be implemented by recording all the MEETING_SCHEDUAL_ID. Then, per MEETING_SCHEDUAL_ID, we could take the information about the meeting location and the meeting start time. 
	2. When the contact tracing system kicks in, the APP would select all the employees (REGISTRATION_ACCOUNT) who have attended the same MEETING_SCHEDUAL_ID and notify them to take lab tests via the SMARTPHONE_NUM stored in the REGISTRATION_ACCOUNT entity.
	3. If any of the notified employees tests positive, then the same operation would occur. First, picks out the MEETING_SCHEDUAL_ID of the positive one and sent an alert to others who have the same MEETING_SCHEDUAL_ID in their record.
	4. Per MEETING_SCHEDUAL_ID, we can obtain the floor of that meeting room. Likewise, per OFFICE_ROOM_NUM, we can get the floor of that man's office room. Then, the message of concern can be sent to those whose office room is located on the same floor as the sick man or those who show up on the same floor that the sick man attends meetings.
	5. Company can check the sick employees' quarantine report daily via all the QUARANTINE data and selected the one who is still in self-quarantine by calculated by START_DATE and current date.
